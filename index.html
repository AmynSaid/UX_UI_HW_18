           <h2>NSA Website ReDesign</h2>
           <h4>Overview:</h4>
           <p>Understand the pain points within a government website and define the particular design problem that exist . Redesign the NSAs website by using the research, define, ideate, prototype and testing stages of design.</p>
           <h4>Role & Responsibility</h4>
           <p>Role: UX Researcher & UI Designer</p> 
           <p>Responsibility: Develop a redesign website of the NSA's website to meet customer needs and maintain or increase the retention rate.</p>
           <h3>User Path</h3>
           <p>My users visit the NSA website to discover cyber threats and how to avoid them to keep privacy rights. Users also visit the site to view the news segment to see the NSA/CSS purpose and discussions with administration or specialists. The NSA/CSS has many components, including cybersecurity, research, and a section for students and educators.</p>
           <h3>Website/Web Pages</h3>
           <p>The NSA/CSS web pages include "About Us", "What We Do", "News & Features", "Resources", "Join our Team", and "Doing Business With Us" web pages. Each of those web pages has an in-depth navigation system to many more outlets that they provide.</p>

           <p>Wireframes:</p>
           <p>Homepage > About Us > Mission Values</p> 
           <p>Homepage > What We Do > Understanding the Threat</p>
           <p>Homepage > News & Features > Digital Media Center > Image Galleries</p>
           <p>Homepage > Resources > Student and Educator > K-12 Partnership</p>
           
            <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
           <p>“The NSA homepage overall was presented well, but navigating from page to page was very complex.”</p> 
            <p>“NSA failed to realise the value of design”</p>
            <p>“Website lacked efficient communication within the design aspect between them and their users.”</p>
            <p>“Website needs both information and the investment in visual communication.”</p>
            <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
            <p>“This task was hard to find just because they had a student section on the homepage and also in the navigation bars. It was easy to locate, but I was a bit confused on why they had it set up like that.”</p>
            <p>“The Conference & Event page is not clear and does not have a clear list of some sort. It takes you to another site which can be misleading for some users.”</p>

            <h3>MoodBoard</h3>
            <p>Fonts: Helvetica, Futura, Times New Roman.</p>
            <p>Creating a website that catches the eyes of the audience at the same time supporting the site with NSAs information.</p> 
            <p>Starting with a clear navigation, Unique landing pages, Pictures tell stories</p>

            <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
            <p>Majority of the navigations where placed in the right place, but for the resources navigation bar that changed the most. </p>
            <p>Join Our Team & Resources had a few pages switched over. This will allow the user to view certain pages without question the placement.</p>

            <h3>Header/Footer Navigation</h3>
            <p>The key for this section when designing was that the information did not need much changing, but it's the way you move things around.</p> 
            <p>For the NSA their social media should be the last thing on the page rather than the second to last as they do on their main site.</p>
            <p>The homepage will include different sections as it had on the NSAs main site. This time there will be variety of sections rather than 2-3.</p>
            <p>Header & Footer match in design and are consistent.</p>

            <h3>Clickable Prototype</h3>
            <p>The hover state was predominantly used in this interaction design.
                Highlighted marks resemble the page you will navigate too when pressed on.</p>

            <h3>High Fidelity Desktop</h3>
            <p>The high fidelity design brings in new features where users can not only view most of what NSA has to offer on one single homepage, but it's highly interactive with user.
                Less clickable buttons and more hover states for users to get the whole format of the website</p>

            <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
            <p>Users performed three simple tasks 
                Navigate to find new information that's released from the NSA.
                How can you join and be a part of the NSA?
                Where would you go to learn about the NSA and what they do?</p>
            <p>Most users were able to navigate with ease, but did not want just text underneath the eye catching image on the homepage, rather they wanted more things that the NSA has to offer.
                With that I was able to shift from my wireframes a little to create something the users need in order for them to have the full experience of the NSAs site.</p>
            <p>Success Rate: Successful, Half Successful, Failure.</p>
            <img src="/Users/amynsaid/Desktop/code/UX_UI_HW_18/Untitled/Screen Shot 2021-10-13 at 2.38.33 PM.png">
            <h3>Case Study Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Research & Problem: 
                The point of this research was based on understanding how people respond to the UI design on a government website of our choice. In this case, this case study was on the National Security Agency (NSA) where I redesigned their site to not only maintain their users, but to also establish user growth and to increase the retention rate. To do that I created a navigation system that works efficiently where users can access what the NSA has to offer on one single homepage.</p>
                
            <p>Goal:
                The goal for this case study was to increase the interaction with existing and potential users by redesigning the RWD UI style guide that already exist. Another factor that I placed an importance on is the organization of content to increase the effectiveness of the call to action of the page.</p>
                
            <p>Future:
                For the websites future, I tend to maintain clear navigation from page to page since there are tons of information that are uploaded to the site. Another factor that I want to maintain is having a stable purpose. The main message of the website should not be lost as time goes by when technology advancing by the day.</p>
